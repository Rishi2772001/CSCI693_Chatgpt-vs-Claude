In these large random cases, ChatGPT’s memoized DFS might short-circuit or skip big parts of the pattern, giving near-constant-time performance on typical random patterns. Meanwhile, Claude’s DP approach systematically fills a table of size  (len(s)+1)×(len(p)+1), which can scale more obviously with input length. That’s why we see ChatGPT appear to handle large random data in near-constant time (exponent ≈ 0.03), and Claude appear to grow roughly O(n^2) (exponent ≈ 2.0) in your plot.
