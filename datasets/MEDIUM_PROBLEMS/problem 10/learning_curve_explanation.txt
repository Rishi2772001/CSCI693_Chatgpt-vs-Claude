Summary: 
- Small local tests: ChatGPT’s DFS overhead is negligible, so it runs fast.
- Large chain-like tests: The DFS overhead accumulates with deep recursion, so ChatGPT’s approach can become slower or risk          recursion-limit issues.
- Claude’s solution uses a reverse-topological approach that is more stable across different input sizes, but might have a slightly larger overhead on tiny graphs.

Hence, ChatGPT appears faster on small local testcases, but Claude’s solution often scales better for large chain graphs—explaining the difference you see between local runs and the learning curve.
